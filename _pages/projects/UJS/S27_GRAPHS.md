TRAVERSAL: Visiting every single node and graph

Real world: nearest neighbors is more common

We have no ROOT, we need to specify a starting point

### Graph Traversal Uses

- Peer to peer networking
- web crawlers
- finding closest matches or recommendations
- shortest path problems
  - GPS nav
  - Solving Mazes
  - AI (shortest path to win the game)

DEPTH FIRST --> Prioritize children
In a graph, DEPTH FIRST simply means moving away from the root
