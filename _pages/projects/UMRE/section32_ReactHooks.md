# Section 32: Introducing React Hooks

## 247. Intro to Hooks & useState

[SANDBOX](https://codesandbox.io/s/umres32247-s3zdu)

### NOTES

- Called "Hooks" because we are "Hooking into" state

* Hooks are new, classes will not leave forever
* Easier to reuse
* Ships with a few hooks

- `useState`

* We call `useState` and give in an initial value
* It returns two things -- a reference to that piece of state, a function that will change that piece of state

## 248. Building a Custom Hook: useToggleState

## 249. Building a Custom Hook: useInputState

## 250. The useEffect Hook

## 251. Fetching Data w/ the useEffect Hook
