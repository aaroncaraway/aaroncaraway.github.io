Afternoons with Aaron:
1. Got excited about successfully creating an API endpoint for our lambda function!
2. HOLD UP: We can't just import Beautiful Soup. Need to do [this whole dance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/lambda-python-how-to-create-deployment-package.html)
3. YAY!! BEAUTIFUL SOUP WORKING!!
4. HOLD UP: We can't actually call the url because, duh, we're in python (backend) and we cannot access the internet so things like urllib and requests don't work.
5. Start a brand new lambda to call our lambda!!
6. Get totally confused and lost and start despairing 

OH yeah and pip stopped working again.
