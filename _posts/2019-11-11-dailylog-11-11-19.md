## THINGS WE CAN DO:

1. Continue down the lambda path -- this way I can access these endpoints from whatever app I make
2. Continue down the EC2 path -- this way I can easily update the app and push live

## LAMBDA PATH

## EC2 PATH

1.

sudo yum install python36



## AFTERNOON UPDATE:

Well, I tried posting to stack overflow for the first time and wow that was a mistake. Already downvoted!

[I've tried adding my path to my data.py file](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42394335/paths-in-aws-lambda-with-python-nltk)

[I've tried this other path adjustment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42382662/using-nltk-corpora-with-aws-lambda-functions-in-python)

[This answer sounds great -- but where do those lines go?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51510854)

[This](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3522372/how-to-config-nltk-data-directory-from-code)  explains how I can access it from my own computer but I really think I understand this -- just somehow cannot transfer that knowledge to my EC2 computer. Which is likely evidence of an aws knowledge gap I'd be so grateful to fill but clearly my own googling isn't helping. Any help/guidance is so appreciated. Yes, I've read the docs. So many times. But clearly it isn't sticking? 

[Non stack-overflow answer saying to add to manifest.yml](https://forum.predix.io/answers/31784/view.html) which would also be awesome except I don't know where/how I'd add this to that file (which is a config.yml for my flask app)

[I'd love to be able to use S3](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55788566)
But I don't actually know where to put that line...

[More on S3 -- where would I put this line?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40539811/using-downloaded-nltk-data-on-aws-elastic-beanstalk?rq=1)


To reiterate, it's not [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41610543/corpora-stopwords-not-found-when-import-nltk-library) issue because I CAN find/use all nltk on my local computer

## CURRENT STATUS AND WHERE TO GO FROM HERE:

1. EC2 Flask App (`v3-aws-flask` running on v3-flask-env)
2. 

## THINGS TO DO:
1. Create reddit account
2. Create matching stack overflow account 
3. Create a new environment on ec2 (done?) add NLTK (done?) put my flask app on it?
4. Create a CRA that hits my python lambda 
5. Give up and go with heroku
