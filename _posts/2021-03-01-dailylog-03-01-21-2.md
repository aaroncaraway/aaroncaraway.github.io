## RE: Caroline Googlesheets

1. Is it best to get ALL the data right away and then simply display what I want when clicked?
2. Should I use useMemo?
3. How many 'useEffects' in one file are too many in one file?

### 30 second summary:

You don't need to use a callback with setState -- you just need to do a useEffect. This is how I did it (not sure if best practice?)

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const formatAboutData = () => {
    if (aboutData) {
      aboutPhoto = aboutData[1].content['$t'];
      console.log('running NOW', aboutData[1].content['$t']);
    }
  };
  formatAboutData();
}, [aboutData]);
```
