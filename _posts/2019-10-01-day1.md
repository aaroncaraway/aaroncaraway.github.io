# Get all your shit together

## What do you do every day?!

If you're anything like me you have no idea what you do unless you religiously record every 25 minutes what exactly you've done/are doing/which file/where/on what planet/covered in which sauce.

MY SOLUTION!

# The Browser Journal

Step 1:
Download all of your histories
(if you're anything like me, you have three+ google profiles to help you manage your multiple personalities/interests/individual dogs within the aformentioned trenchcoat)

Step 2: 
Use this handy file to turn it into a JSON we actually want to use
(this will likely vary between sources -- i.e. if (search_history){run codeA} if (bank_history){ run codeB} but we're getting ahead of ourselves)
