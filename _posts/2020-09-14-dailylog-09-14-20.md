## How to see the files you've created today

TODAY I LEARNED TO LIST ALL THE FILES I CREATED WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS!!

```console
find . -mtime -1 -type f -print
```

EXPORT TO A CSV

```console
find . -mtime -1 -type f -print > opened-today.csv
```

I also learned that if you do that in your parent directory, you will have a zillion of cache files. This was an interesting learning moment for me... WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ALL OF THOSE CACHE FILES?!?!

## How to analyze the files you've created today

### BEFORE THAT WORKED I TRIED:

a workaround!

```python
def get_parent(file):
    return file.split('/')[1]
df['main'] = df.apply(lambda x: get_parent(x['files']), axis=1)
df
```

another workaround!

```python
new_df = og_df.copy()
new_df['files'] = new_df['files'].str.replace("/", "---")
new_df
nd = new_df['files'].str.split('---', 0, expand=True)
nd
```
