TODAY I LEARNED TO LIST ALL THE FILES I CREATED WITHIN THE LAST 24 HOURS!!

```console
find . -mtime -1 -type f -print
```

EXPORT TO A CSV

```console
find . -mtime -1 -type f -print > opened-today.csv
```

I also learned that if you do that in your parent directory, you will have a zillion of cache files. This was an interesting learning moment for me... WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ALL OF THOSE CACHE FILES?!?!
