1. Unzip files

### NOTES FROM A PAST LIFE

I kept getting this infuriating error on my phone when I would scan the QR code -- "The experience you requested uses Expo SDK v(null), but this copy of Expo Client..." etc.

I did A LOT of googling and tried many different things but ultimately what ended up working was

1. COMPLETELY uninstalling expo-cli `npm -g uninstall expo-cli --save && yarn global remove expo-cli`

2. Removing all traces `cd ~ && rm -rf .expo`

3. Starting at the top of this document and going through it all over again. This time, I also followed Step 5 exactly (and put the folder into ~/ ... which makes my skin crawl) because previously I had it in my own "PROJECTS" directory. So technically I changed two things and I have no idea which one is responsible for everything magically working again...?

## 197. Navigation Design

Stack Navigator
Bottom Tab Navigator
Switch Navigator
Drawer Navigator

Sign up should be using `switch navigator`

[GET EXPO QR CODE TO WORK ON PHONE](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57796485/react-native-app-with-expo-qr-code-not-loading)

npm install react-navigation

expo install react-native-gesture-handler react-native-reanimated react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context @react-native-community/masked-view

npm install react-navigation-stack @react-native-community/masked-view

npm install react-navigation-tabs

expo r -c

### 199. a LOT of Boilerplate

1. Make src directory in same level as node_modules
2. make screens directory inside it
3. Make a file for each screen (e.g. SignupScreen.js)

Delete everything from `App.js`

import AccountScreen from './src/screensAccountScreen
