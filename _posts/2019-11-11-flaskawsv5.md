Here it is, ugly and working and I am [so proud](http://flask-env-v5.g8dfvcd6bz.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/)

NOTE: Before doing below, follow [this jazz](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create-deploy-python-flask.html)
... but don't specifiy flask type and only use pip3 for installing and freezing requirements
step-by-step coming tomorrow 

# NLTK on AWS (so we can use it with a Python Flask app!)

## QUICK OVERVIEW:

### FOR LOCAL:
ssh into your instance with `eb ssh`
Download python3
Install NLTK
python >> import nltk
python >> nltk.download()

### FOR NON-LOCAL
Download the NLTK data you need
Unzip it into appropriate folder (e.g. nltk_data/tokenizers/punkt) [more info here](http://www.nltk.org/data.html#manual-installation) data zips [here](http://www.nltk.org/nltk_data/)
Migrate that folder to the S3 bucket that already belongs with your app environment
(for me that was `s3://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-386305625872/flask-tutorial-v5-env/nltk_data`)
Create a file `.ebextensions` [look here for examples](https://github.com/awsdocs/elastic-beanstalk-samples/blob/master/configuration-files/aws-provided/instance-configuration/install-nodejs.config)
Add the below to the file 

### 

### ebextensions 
(make a file .ebextensions):
Put this in there
(We likely don't need the first command)

```command
commands:
  01_download_nltk_data:
    command: "python3 -m pip install nltk"
  
  02_copy_nltk_data:
    command: "aws s3 cp s3://elasticbeanstalk-us-west-2-386305625872/flask-tutorial-v5-env/nltk_data /usr/local/share/nltk_data --recursive"
```

What eventually worked for me:
[This](https://stackoverflow.com/a/55788566/12357926)
But I didn't have to make an environment variable, I just did the commands line...
Which makes me wonder if it was adding this line to the paths (see 'ADDED PATHS' below) that helped?

### Added Paths
I added `str('/root/nltk_data'),` to this code block found in `v5-aws-flask/v5-virt/lib/python3.7/site-packages/nltk/data.py`

```python
else:
    # Common locations on UNIX & OS X:
    path += [
        os.path.join(sys.prefix, str('nltk_data')),
        os.path.join(sys.prefix, str('share'), str('nltk_data')),
        os.path.join(sys.prefix, str('lib'), str('nltk_data')),
        str('/usr/share/nltk_data'),
        str('/usr/local/share/nltk_data'),
        str('/usr/lib/nltk_data'),
        str('/usr/local/lib/nltk_data'),
        str('/root/nltk_data'),
    ]
```

1. Calm down
