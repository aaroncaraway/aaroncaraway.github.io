### Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

1. sum of squares
2. sum, squared
3. 1-2
---
1. list all the numbers
2. add number to TOTAL
2. square them
3. Add squared number to TOTAL_SUM_OF_SQUARES
4. When done, TOTAL_SUM_OF_SQUARES - TOTAL

```python
num = 1
total = 0
total_sum_of_squares = 0
while num <= 100:
    total += num
    total_sum_of_squares += num*num
    num +=1
    
(total*total) - total_sum_of_squares
```
