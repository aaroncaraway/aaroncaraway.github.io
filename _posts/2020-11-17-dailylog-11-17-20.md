## Third attempt (from the book):

```python
# 1. Create row and column arrays to store which rows and columns have zeros
# 2. loop through rows - if row has zero, add it to row array
# 3. loop through columns - if column has zero, add it to column array
# 4. loop through the rows again, checking to see if that row is "ZEROED", if so, replace subsequent values
# 5. loop through the columns again, checkint to see if that column is "ZEROED", if so, replace subsequent values

def zeroMatrix(matrix):
    row = [False] * len(matrix)
    col = [False] * len(matrix[0])
    
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            if matrix[i][j] == 0:
                row[i] = True
                row[j] = True
    
    for i in range(len(matrix)):
        for j in range(len(matrix[0])):
            if row[i] == True or row[j] == True:
                matrix[i][j] = 0
                
    return matrix
    
    
# test = [[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[2,3,2]]
test = [[0,1,1],[0,1,3],[1,1,1],[2,3,2]]
zeroMatrix(test)
```

## Second attempt:

As a human computer, I will:
1. make a copy of the matrix MATRIX_COPY
2. loop through the ORIGINAL_MATRIX ROW by ROW
3. I will check if 0 is in the ROW -- the second I get to a 0 I can stop looping and set ZERO_PRESENT: True
4. If ZERO_PRESENT, loop through each item in that ROW of MATRIX_COPY and turn it into a zero
5. (Do this for all rows)
6. Now, do the same thing but with COLUMNS

### Working for Rows
```python

def zeroMatrix(matrix):
    matrix_copy = matrix
    
    for i,row in enumerate(matrix):
        for num in row:
            if num == 0:
                matrix_copy[i] = [0] * len(row)
                break
            else:
                matrix_copy[i] = row
                
    return matrix_copy
    
test = [[0,1,1],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
zeroMatrix(test)
```

## First attempt

As a human computer, I will:
1. loop through the matrix ROW by ROW
2. I will check if 0 is in the ROW -- the second I get to a 0 I can stop looping and set ZERO_PRESENT: True
3. If ZERO_PRESENT, update MATRIX_COPY
3. turn all numbers in the ROW to 0
4. but save this to a new matrix because we still need the old one for when we do the same thing for columns
