## What did you do today?

Well, I started out by continuing to work on my “External Hard Drive Project” -- which is basically me being lazy and instead of going through each of my TEN external hard drives, writing scripts to 1. Rename 2. Flatten 3. Sort my files so I can be like “What photos was I taking in 2005?!” “What projects did I work on in may 2014?” -- well, I seem to only have photos from 2005 (so far on the two I’ve “processed”) and they were a bunch of Cody photos and I was like OMG WHAT IF I DON’T KNOW WHAT I’VE DONE BEFORE 2005 BECAUSE I HAVE NO DIGITAL PHOTOS. So I freaked out, naturally, and made a spreadsheet of every month and year I was alive and what school/job I was at at the time and what significant other I was with at the time
