PROBLEM:

You're bad at daily journaling but you want a record of your life

SOLUTION:

Keep your text messages as "records" of what you did that day!!

PROBLEM:

Apple doesn't make it easy to export your text messages

SOLUTION:

Use PhoneView!

PROBLEM:

You need 256 GB of space to do a PhoneView backup (or any backup)

SOLUTION:

Use an external hard drive!

PROBLEM:

For reasons unknown, I couldn't store my iphone backups on an external hard drive without first turning it into a bootable drive

SOLUTION:

Wipe husband's old computer. Use this. Create iPhone backup the apple way....

PROBLEM:

This is the apple way and you still can't access everything...

SOLUTION:

Use PhoneView and then select "iTunes Backups" and boom it's accessing the messages from the itunes back up because if you try to ALSO do a PhoneView backup on the same computer that you have a apple-iphone-backup, you won't have enough space
