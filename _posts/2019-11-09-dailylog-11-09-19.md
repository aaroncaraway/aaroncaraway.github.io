ERRORS!
Maybe maybe maybe have to do with using ONLY `pip3` never just `pip`


TROUBLESHOOTING PYTHON + AWS
1. Redo AMAZON flask tutorial

python3 -m venv v2-virt
source v2-virt/bin/activate
pip install flask==1.0.2
pip freeze > requirements.txt


eb init -p python-3.6 v2-aws-flask --region us-west-2
eb create v2-flask-env

2. Add summarizer stuff gradually into the amazon tutorial


```
import requests

url = 'https://www.google.com/'
r = requests.get(url)
r.text
```
