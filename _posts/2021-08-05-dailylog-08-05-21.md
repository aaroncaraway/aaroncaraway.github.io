## Storing the Token

1. Add AsyncStorage `npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage`
2. Import AsyncStorage to AuthContext `import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';`
3. In our signup function, after the response, use AsyncStorage to setItem `await AsyncStorage.setItem('token', response.data.token);`
4. We want to update our token in state so we will have to DISPATCH an action...
   1. Add another case to our authReducer switch statements (e.g. type: signup)
5. NOW, we can update our export const to return a token instead of `isSignedIn: false` because if there is no token, we know user is not signed in
